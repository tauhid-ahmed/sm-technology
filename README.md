# 🚀 SM Technology – Frontend Developer Task

Hi there! 👋
Thank you for reviewing this submission for the **Frontend Developer Position at SM Technology**. This project is built using **Next.js 14 (Turbopack)** with **TypeScript** and **Tailwind CSS**, following the provided Figma designs and API documentation.

---

## 📁 Project Overview

**Objective**:
Build a fully responsive and pixel-perfect frontend based on the given Figma designs and integrate it with real backend APIs (as documented in Postman).

> ⚠️ **Note on Design**:
> Due to Figma export restrictions, manual inspection and interpretation were needed — nothing could be copied or exported directly. This required attention to detail and best judgment in places where exact specs weren't accessible.
